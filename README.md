## Introduction

DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention) is a transformer model developed by Microsoft. This project focuses on fine-tuning DeBERTa to improve its performance on a specific task: predicting human preferences in LLM responses. The fine-tuning process leverages a portion of the LMSYS dataset.

## Features

- **Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Utilizes Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model efficiently.
- **Disentangled Attention Mechanism**: Enhances model performance by separating content and positional information.
- **Special Tokens Handling**: Incorporates special tokens for better task-specific adaptation.
- **Resource Optimization**: Freezes layers to reduce computational load and speed up training.
